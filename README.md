Project - SpaceX
SpaceX is founded by Elon Musk in 2002. Its Falcon 9 rocket, known for its reusable first stage, has revolutionised the industry by landing boosters for reuse, achieving a cost of $62 million per launch compared to competitors' $165 million. SpaceX has accomplished historic milestones, including being the first private company to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit in 2010. The company also conducts Starlink missions, deploying satellites for global internet coverage, and has partnerships with NASA for crewed missions to the International Space Station. This project analyse SpaceX launch data to predict first-stage landing success, aiding cost estimation for competitive bids.
